/* ● You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
● You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different
day in the future to sell that stock.
● Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit,
return 0.
● Example 1:
○ Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
○ Output: 5
○ Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
○ Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you
sell.
● Example 2:
○ Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
○ Output: 0
○ Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
